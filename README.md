# Predicting Energy Use of Lights and Appliances in a Low-Energy Building

This project aims to predict the energy use of lights and appliances in a low-energy building using the UCI dataset collected in 2017. The dataset for this project is available on Canvas. The target variable for this prediction is the total energy use.

## Project Overview

In this project, I will investigate at least two completely separate types of supervised machine learning algorithms, ensuring that at least one method is a non-neural network-based algorithm. I will fully train our own algorithms, avoiding the use of pre-trained systems. Given that the dataset contains time-series information, constructing additional features to represent this information may be necessary to improve the model. Feature selection and ensemble learning methods may be used but do not count towards the requirement of testing two distinct algorithms.

## Project Objectives

1. **Algorithms**:
   - Implement at least two supervised machine learning algorithms.
   - Ensure one algorithm is non-neural network based.

2. **Training**:
   - Fully train the algorithms using the provided dataset.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Construct additional features to represent the time-series information.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Research and compare results with existing published works.

## Dataset

The dataset was published as part of the following paper:
Luis M. Candanedo, Veronique Feldheim, Dominique Deramaix, "Data-driven prediction models of energy use of appliances in a low-energy house," Energy and Buildings, Volume 140, 1 April 2017, Pages 81-97, ISSN 0378-7788.

## Independent Evaluation

As part of the independent evaluation, I will:
- Research a number of published works that use this dataset.
- Evaluate, compare, and contrast my results with these works.
- Discuss the challenges faced during the independent comparison.
